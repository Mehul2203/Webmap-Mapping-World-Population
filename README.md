# Webmap Mapping World Population
+ This mini project focuses on the population count of several countries of the world. It gives users a GUI of the world map, representing countries with three different colours red, yellow and green based on their population count either overpopulated or moderate population or normal population.       
+ The three different colours representing the countries makes it easier for the users to understand the population condition and makes the map user friendly. It also have markers marking the locations of different volcanoes in the North America region. These markers are also in three different colours red, yellow and green based on the height of the volcanoes. It also pops out the height (in meters) of the volcanoes when we click on the marker thereby providing user friendly and attractive interface with the users.     
+ A user can also zoom in and zoom out on the map and can move the map using the mouse. Map also displays names of the continents as we zoom out and when zoom in it shows names of countries and further zoom in displays the states and cities. It also provides a control layer on the top right corner for the users.       
+ So, the main objective is to represent world population and some volcanoes on a world map providing attractive and very useful interface to the users.
